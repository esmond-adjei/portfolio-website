# Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website built with React. It showcases some of my projects and skills as a web developer. You can browse through different sections of the website, such as:

- About Me
- Projects
- Contact
- Blog.
  The website is responsive and works on different screen sizes and devices.

To run the website locally, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then, clone this repository and run the following commands in the terminal:

`npm install`
`npm start`

This will install the dependencies and start the development server.
You can then open [localhost](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

To build the website for production, run the following command:

`npm run build`

This will create a build folder with the optimized files for deployment. You can use any static hosting service to host the website online.
